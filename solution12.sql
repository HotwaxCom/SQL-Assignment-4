12. List the Productâ€™s Primary ID
Business Problem:
Every retailer has a specific product ID type that they throughout their systems for consistency, such as SKU or UPCA. Identify which one is used, and return the ID value for all products.

Fields to Retrieve:

PRODUCT_ID
PRIMARY ID TYPE
PRIMARY ID VALUE
    
select 
    p.product_id,
    gi.good_identification_type_id as PRIMARY_ID_TYPE,
    gi.id_value as PRIMARY_ID_VALUE
from product p
join good_identification gi 
    on gi.product_id = p.product_id
where gi.thru_date is null;

-- We were asked about the unique identification code that is used for every product and their respective
-- values as well, so used good_identification table for this and ensured that the thru date is null which 
-- tells that the id remains active.
